# RaspberryPi-Sureveillance-SCD

Code for the project is entirely built off of python. Purpose is for the first pi to recognise the presented face. Then determines if the face is on the system and should be allowed to enter, if it isnt on the system then the person is denied entry.

The second raspberry Pi is responsible for the Apache web Server. The framework we will be using is the Django framework. This pi will recieve live camera footage from the first raspberry pi and display it on the website allowing the homeowner/admin to vieew it from anywhere.
